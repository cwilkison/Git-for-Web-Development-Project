Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    block elements: start on new line and take up full available width.
    inline elements: does not start on new line and takes necessary width needed.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    An element positioned absolutely will stay near its nearest parent.  I believe this means for example, if you
    click a link that opens a input window, the input window will set next to the link.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    ex: img{
        display: initial;
        width: 300px;
    }
    >>> sets the image display as its initial/default values, then use width: 300px to change width to 300px or whatever
    is wanted.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block: header, footer, section  inline: span, a   inline-block: button, input, select
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    All HTML elements are within the box model.  In CSS the box model allows you to manage the the margin, border,
    padding and content.  The box starts with the margin as the outer most area, tehn border then padding and finally
    the content.  You can change height and width of each section as well as color and line style for border.
    content = content
    padding = area around content
    border = a border that wraps around content and padding
    margin = final area around the border
